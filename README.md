# django-website

## Short description of what you attempted to build
I built a URL shortener using Python and Django. I followed a tutorial to create the interface and overall the attempt was successful except for my inability to get the project to deploy through Heroku. The interface has an input bar where a URL link can be entered, upon clicking on the 'shorten' button, a new link is popped out that allows the user to access the original URL link but under a shortened name. 

## Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
I worked on this Hack-a-Thing by myself

## What you learned
1. I spent all of the last Hack-A-Thing trying to work on a project involving Django but eventually gave up because I was running into importing/dependency issues. This time around I learned how to fix my import issue. Turns out VSCode by default was using Python 2.X when I needed to use Python 3.X, so after trying out multiple solutions from Stack Overflow I finally landed upon a solution that worked - henceby allowing me to use and import Django.
2. I learned how to apply and use Django in a project
3. How to create an interface using Python

## What didnâ€™t work
1. I initially was working on a project involving using Dash Boostrap and Python Dash Visualization to create a financial dashboard. The Dash app wouldn't run so I switched over to this project involving Django since I've always wanted to learn and work with Django.
2. I could not figure out how to deploy it using Heroku. Bash wouldn't take 'heroku login' as a command no matter what solutions I found online and tried.
3. I realized that after pulling up the code again. Python, for some reason, would default back to version 2.X which made the process really difficult because I would have to switch it back to 3.X every time and would have to reinstall all my dependencies like Django.

## How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
It inspires me to do more Python-based web development. I know Python isn't really known for any of their frameworks - unlike Javascript with React - but it was really neat to be able to use the language and Django to create a UI, since I've only created data visualizations with Python and not interfaces.
